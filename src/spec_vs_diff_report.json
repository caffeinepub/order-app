  "summary": "SettingsCard UI was modified to remove header/title and labels, but an <Input> is still rendered in the first settings field area, which may correspond to the XPath that was required to be removed. Additionally, new UI elements (helper text and a conditional \"Save Changes\" button) appear to have been added beyond the four specified removals.",

      "requirement": "Remove the element at XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/main[1]/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/div[1]/input[1] (the first Settings input) so it is no longer rendered.",
      "reason": "The updated SettingsCard.tsx still renders an <Input> inside the first settings field block (<div className=\"space-y-2\"> ... <Input ... />), which likely maps to the referenced first input XPath position.",
