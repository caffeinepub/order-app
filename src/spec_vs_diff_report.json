The only clearly evidenced changes are global styling/theme updates, which are outside the stated requirements for this build request.",

      "reason": "The diff summary reports no added files (Added: 0) and does not show any public/static asset files (e.g., sample CSV/XLSX) being added. The provided App.tsx snippet is truncated before any download controls can be verified.",
